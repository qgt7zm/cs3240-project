                                    It's crucial to prioritize and organize. Utilize planners and scheduling apps to
                                    block out time for studying, training, and rest. Don't hesitate to talk to your
                                    coaches and teachers about your schedule so they can provide support. Remember,
                                    taking breaks and self-care activities are just as important as your academic and
                                    athletic commitments.

                                    student-athletes to manage their mental health. Additionally, make sure you're
                                    getting enough rest, eating healthily, staying hydrated, and maintaining social
                                    connections.

                                    Post-competition recovery is as crucial as the preparation. It includes active
                                    recovery, proper nutrition, hydration, sleep, and mental rest. Techniques such as
                                    meditation, yoga, and even hobbies outside sports can help in psychological

                                    Conversely, a poor diet can lead to fatigue, impaired decision-making, and increased
